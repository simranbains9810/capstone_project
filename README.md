# capstone_project
Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyse and predict financial and non-financial risks.

This project presents a proof of concept (PoC) for how named entity recognition (NER), network analysis, K-means clustering, LSTM and ARIMA models can be applied to analyse and predict financial and non-financial risks from unstructured information. Leveraging machine learning, data science and statistical methodologies through Python libraries such as SpaCy, Fuzzy, NetworkX, PyTorch and Pmdarima, it facilitates nuanced analysis to extract critical insights. Furthermore, the project sheds light on potential avenues for augmenting the precision of models and insights through sustained research and development.
